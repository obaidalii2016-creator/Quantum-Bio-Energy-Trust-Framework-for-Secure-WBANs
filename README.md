Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) confront formidable obstacles in delivering efficient, secure, and reliable real-time biomedical monitoring, as conventional approaches falter under energy constraints, security vulnerabilities, and excessive latency. This paper unveils QuanBioTrust, an innovative routing protocol that seamlessly blends quantum-enhanced optimization, bio-inspired swarm intelligence, and a dynamic trust framework to surmount these hurdles. By employing Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO), QuanBioTrust refines cluster head selection and routing paths within a quantum-superposed solution space, reducing computational complexity (~500 operations/round, 15 nJ/bit), a stark improvement over HCEL (~700 ops) and EGWO (~1000 ops). Drawing from nature ingenuity, including flocking cohesion, firefly synchronization, and slime mold foraging, it fosters adaptive clustering, robust multi-hop routing, and smart data fusion. A predator-prey trust model, enhanced by lightweight deep reasoning, fortifies security, achieving a 95.3% threat reduction (99.9% eavesdropping protection) and outperforming EGWO (70%) and EDC-ER (24%). Bio-energy harvesting (20–50 µW) and quantum compression (50–70% reduction) drive energy use to 9.8×10⁶ nJ, surpassing HCEL (12.5×10⁶ nJ), while ensuring self-sustainability. In a 50-node MIT-BIH simulation spanning 10,000 rounds, QuanBioTrust achieves a 12,800-round lifetime, 97% PDR (90% under attack), and 48 ms latency (185 ms under attack), eclipsing EAFST (1000/1200 ms) and rivaling EDC-ER (50/180 ms) (p<0.01, SD <5%). This quantum-biological fusion redefines WBAN standards, offering a scalable, secure, and efficient paradigm for advanced biomedical monitoring.
